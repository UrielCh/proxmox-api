# Contributing to proxmox-api

Thank you for your interest in contributing to proxmox-api! Your time and effort are greatly appreciated. Every contribution, no matter how small, is valued.

## Code of Conduct

Before contributing, please read our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). All contributors are expected to adhere to these guidelines to ensure a positive and inclusive environment.

## Getting Started

- Ensure you have a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.
- Fork the repository on GitHub (click the "Fork" button at the top right of the main repository page).
- Clone the forked repository to your local machine.

## Making Changes

- You can make changes directly to the `main` branch of your forked repository or create a new branch for your changes: `git checkout -b your-feature-name`.
- Make your changes.
- Try to commit your changes in logical chunks and provide clear and descriptive commit messages.
- Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub.

## Code Formatting

To maintain code consistency and readability, avoid making code reformatting changes in your PRs. Any PR solely for code reformatting will be rejected. If you believe code reformatting is necessary, consider updating or adding a formatting script instead. By doing this, we can ensure the codebase remains consistent and easily reviewable, focusing on the implementation changes.

## Submitting Changes

- Once you've pushed your changes, create a Pull Request from your forked repository's interface.
- In the Pull Request description, clearly describe the problem and solution, and include the relevant issue number if applicable.
- All non-trivial fixes should include comprehensive tests to prevent regression.

## Testing

We value and encourage contributions that include testing. If you're submitting non-trivial changes, please include tests that cover the new functionality or bug fix.

## Review Process

After submitting a Pull Request, project maintainers and contributors will review your contribution. This is a collaborative process, and we aim to work together to help get your PRs merged.

Thank you again for your interest in contributing. We look forward to seeing your contributions!
